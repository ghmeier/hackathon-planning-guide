(and how this guide will help you plan one)\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo you’re interested in planning a hackathon at Iowa State. We built this guide to help you get through planning one without making the same mistakes we’ve made (and believe us we’ve made mistakes). \r\n\r\n\r\nIt might help to know what we’re talking about first. Hackathons are events lasting anywhere from a few hours to multiple days where people gather to built technical projects. At their base, hackathons can be a few people in a room programming, but they often grow to include hundreds of people. \r\n\r\n![Sometimes whole auditoriums full.](https://web.cs.ship.edu/media/1234226_10152212492125410_580233724_n.jpg) \r\n\r\nThese larger events often include technical presentations, prizes, and lots of experimental hardware. Hackathons are great, but planning hackathons can be daunting and filled with lots of important details. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe built this guide to help you focus on having a great event rather than figuring out the gritty details and running into the same problems we’ve run into before. In the rest of this guide is built to give you all the logistical details you’ll need to plan your hackathon at Iowa State  as well as some tips, tricks, and best practices based on past experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter going through this guide you’re most of the way to having the logistics of your hackathon planned. We’ve left planning the specifics of your event (aka the fun part) to you. _**The only thing you need to get started, is an existing Iowa State Student organization.**_\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t have a student organization? Here are some options:\r\n+ Make one (it’s not too hard): [http://www.sac.iastate.edu/student-organizations/starting-a-new-organization/](The SAC has a Guide)\r\n+ Talk to Iowa State’s hackathon planning club, HackISU (hackiowastate@gmail.com)\r\n+ Visit some technical clubs and see if they’d be interested in running a hackathon.\r\n\r\n##Creating a Planning Timeline\r\n---\r\n\r\nOoh sweet sweet timelines\r\n\r\n##Gathering a Team and Team Roles\r\n---\r\n\r\nWho should you have and what should they do?\r\n\r\n##Making a Hackathon Budget\r\n---\r\n\r\nCreating a budget is an especially critical part of planning a Hackathon and really any sort of event. \r\n\r\n##Developing Your Sponsorship Plan\r\n---\r\n\r\nGettin Dollas\r\n\r\n##University Rules and Regulations\r\n---\r\n\r\nISU helps, but you gotta let them.\r\n",
